# ITP Data Analysis Project

This project is under the research project `S25 WLIURA - Undergraduate Research Asst Arctic Oceanography` with Dr. Stephanie Waterman from University of British Columbia as supervisor. This repository aims to utilize Ice-Tethered Profiler (ITP) data to explore the backgound properties of the Arctic Ocean Atlantic Water Thermocline, discover its relation with staircase structure dynamics, and eventually acheive the parameterization of microstructure-level mechanism. 

## For future Ocean users:
run
`git pull origin main` to obtain the latest update of this repository

## Repository Structures
- root
    1. Data folders:
        - `goldData`: folder for gold-standard dataset
        - `gridData`: folder for gridded gold-standard dataset, in `.csv` format
        - `gridDataMat`: folder for gridded gold-standard dataset, in `.mat` format
        - `rawData`: unprocessed dataset from the ITP website
        - `plots`: folder for all plots generated by scripts.
    2. Scripts:
        - `00_testField.ipynb`
        - `01_pullData.py`
        - `02_cleanData.py`
        - `03_gridMaker.py`
        - `04_backgroundCalculation.py`
        - `05_presentPlots.py` 
        - `06_singleReader.py`
        - `helper.py` 
    3. README.md
    4. MATLAB script folder, the helper functions are not organized into separate folders for easier functioncall:
        - `01_pullData.m`
        - `02_cleanData.m`
        - `03_gridMaker.m`
        - `04_backgroundCalculation.m`
        - `05_presentPlots.m` 
        - `06_singleReader.m`
        - `checkField.m` 
        - `countData.m` 
        - `height.m` 
        - `pressure.m`
        - `read_var.m`
        - `traverse_dataset.m`    

## List of scripts and their funcionalities:
| Script Name          | Functionalities |
| -----------          | --------------- |
| `00_testField.ipynb` | test field for new functions, you can print out steps, making it easier for debugging.|
| `01_pullData.py`     | download and unzip the cormat files into the folder `datasets`. it also organizes the files in ITP system number.|
| `02_cleanData.py`    | Comb through every profile in `datasets` folder. Save profiles that matches the "gold standard" into another folder named `goldData`.|
| `03_gridMaker.py`    | Take profiles from `goldData`, interpolate the data into a 0.25 m regular grided dataset, stores them in folders. The csv version is stored in folder named `gridData`, `.mat` version stored in the `gridDataMat` folder.|
| `04_backgroundCalculation.py`      | Calculate the background properties, such as temperature gradient, salinity gradient, and density gradient ratio. It will summarize it, combine it with gold-standard dataset, and store the result into `test.pkl`.|
| `05_presentPlots.py`    |Script for producing all plots used in the seminar presentation. |
| `06_singleReader.py` | Tool for checking individual profile when something goes wrong.|
| `helper.py`          | Place for all helper functions|
| `10_machineLearning.py`  | a toy logistic time series regression with metrics and feature importance analysis|
